==============================================================================

NAME
    Data::Hexdumper - 

SYNOPSIS

    in user's code:

	     use Data::Hexdumper;

	     print Hexdump(
	       data => $data,            # a blob of binary data
	       number_format => 'v',     # the format to use
	       start_position => 100000, # starting offset in file
	       end_position => 100511    # ending offset
	     );

INSTALLATION

    Do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

DESCRIPTION

    If you've ever needed to work with binary data files - in particular
    nasty files whose documentation is largely a work of fiction, then
    you will appreciate the need for a tool to help make sense of the
    structure.  There is already a Data::HexDump module (by Fabien Tassin,
    fta@oleane.net) which you should use if your needs are simple.
    However, Data::Hexdumper gives you a lot more options, to control
    things like whether to dump in bytes, shorts or longs, and in little-
    endian or big-endian order.
